WHAT IS THIS

I've been inspired by this replica of Minecraft written in C++.


VISIONS:
- Multithreaded chunk generation
- Low memory required
- Multiplayer
- API for the creation of game modes. Uses Lua
  - The hope is to allow players to make of the game they choose. They can create bosses, materials, custom game progressions, etc.
  - If possible, eventually, there could be an AI layer that sits on top and assists the creator.
- There are two modes: edit and play.
   - Play allows you to play game modes you've already created
   - Edit allows for an easy way to edit the game mode and see what the game would look like.
     - Users are also free to edit or upload script game files
